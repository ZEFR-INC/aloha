/** Allows a way to read multiple readable types at once.  This is especially useful because we can use this in
  * spring with a model factory that is prototype scoped so that we can create the model factory once, it reads all of
  * the models in bulk and then the factory can be thrown away.  This way, we don't have large unnecessary objects
  * lying around that are only useful at initialization time.
  *
  * @tparam A the readable sources.  This allows objects that mix in only a subset of Readable interfaces to have type
  *           safety when trying to parse multiple sources.  This allows the programmer to use the type system instead
  *           of needing to deal with cases that shouldn't exists.  For instance, imagine implementing just
  *           NonFileReadable.  Then, we shouldn't have to test for cases where the readable source refers to a File.
  *           The type hierarchy of ReadableSource allows this.
  * @tparam B the output type of the objects produced by consuming the Readables.
